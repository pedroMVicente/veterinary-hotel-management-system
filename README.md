# Veterinary Hotel Management System

A comprehensive Java-based hotel management system for a veterinary facility featuring keepers, veterinarians, habitats with trees, and advanced satisfaction algorithms. Built with object-oriented design patterns and extensible architecture.

## Project Overview

This system manages a veterinary hotel where animals of various species are cared for by keepers (responsible for feeding and habitat cleaning) and veterinarians (responsible for animal health through vaccinations). The application calculates satisfaction levels for both animals and staff based on complex formulas considering multiple environmental and social factors.

## Core Entities

### Animals & Species

**Species**
- Unique identifier (case-insensitive string)
- Unique name
- Registry of all animals belonging to the species

**Animals**
- Unique identifier (case-insensitive string)
- Name (non-unique)
- Species association
- Health status history (vaccination events)
- Habitat assignment

**Animal Satisfaction Formula:**
```
satisfaction(a) = 20 + 3×same_species(a,h) - 2×different_species(a,h) 
                  + area(h)/population(h) + suitability(a,h)
```
Where suitability is: +20 (positive), -20 (negative), or 0 (neutral - default)

### Habitats

**Properties:**
- Unique identifier (case-insensitive string)
- Name (non-unique)
- Area (integer)
- Tree associations
- Animal population
- Species suitability influences

Habitats can be more or less suitable for specific species, directly impacting animal satisfaction.

### Trees

**Tree Types:**
- **Deciduous (CADUCA)**: Lose leaves mainly in autumn, bare in winter
- **Evergreen (PERENE)**: Lose some leaves year-round, more in winter

**Properties:**
- Unique identifier (case-insensitive string)
- Name (non-unique)
- Age in years (integer)
- Base cleaning difficulty (integer)
- Biological cycle based on current season

**Cleaning Effort Formula:**
```
cleaning_effort(t) = base_difficulty(t) × seasonal_effort(t) × log(age(t) + 1)
```

**Seasonal Effort Table:**
| Season | Winter | Spring | Summer | Autumn |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Deciduous | 0 | 1 | 2 | 5 |
| Evergreen | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Biological Cycle States:**
| Type | Winter | Spring | Summer | Autumn |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| CADUCA | SEMFOLHAS | GERARFOLHAS | COMFOLHAS | LARGARFOLHAS |
| PERENE | LARGARFOLHAS | GERARFOLHAS | COMFOLHAS | COMFOLHAS |

Trees age by 1 year every 4 seasons and follow the application's current season.

### Employees

**Keepers (TRT)**
- Responsible for habitat maintenance
- Assigned to zero or more habitats
- Affected by cleaning workload

**Keeper Satisfaction Formula:**
```
satisfaction(k) = 300 - work(k)
work(k) = Σ (habitat_work(h) / keepers_for_habitat(h)), h ∈ habitats(k)
habitat_work(h) = area(h) + 3×population(h) + Σ cleaning_effort(t), t ∈ trees(h)
```

**Veterinarians (VET)**
- Authorized to vaccinate specific species
- Assigned to zero or more species
- Affected by animal population workload

**Veterinarian Satisfaction Formula:**
```
satisfaction(v) = 20 - work(v)
work(v) = Σ (population(s) / vets_for_species(s)), s ∈ species(v)
```

### Vaccines

**Properties:**
- Unique identifier (case-insensitive string)
- Name (non-unique)
- List of applicable species
- Complete vaccination history (vaccine, vet, animal, order)

**Vaccination Damage System:**

When a vaccine is administered to an animal:

1. **Correct species**: damage = 0 → **NORMAL**
2. **Wrong species, damage = 0**: → **CONFUSÃO**
3. **Damage 1-4**: → **ACIDENTE**
4. **Damage ≥ 5**: → **ERRO**

**Damage Calculation:**
```
damage(v, a) = MAX(name_size(species(a), s) - common_chars(species(a), s)), 
               s ∈ applicable_species(v)
name_size(s1, s2) = max(length(s1), length(s2))
```

Example: Vaccinating a bird (AVE) with a mammal (MAMÍFERO) vaccine = 6 damage

Health history example: `ACIDENTE,ACIDENTE,ERRO,ERRO,ERRO,NORMAL`

## Key Features

### Season Management
- Four seasons: Spring (0), Summer (1), Autumn (2), Winter (3)
- Application starts in Spring
- Advance season affects all trees
- Trees age every 4 seasons

### Satisfaction System
- Real-time calculation for animals and employees
- Complex formulas considering multiple factors
- Global satisfaction tracking
- Rounded to nearest integer for display

### Vaccination System
- Authorization checks (vet must be qualified for species)
- Wrong vaccine warnings
- Automatic damage calculation and health history tracking
- Complete vaccination audit trail

### Persistent Storage
- Java serialization for state preservation
- Text file import for initial data loading
- Single active file per session
- Unsaved changes warnings

### Design Patterns

**1. Strategy Pattern** - Employee Satisfaction Calculation
- Runtime satisfaction policy changes
- New calculation strategies without code modification
- Default formulas as described in specification

**2. State Pattern** - Tree Seasonal Behavior
- Seasonal state transitions
- Extensible for new seasonal behaviors (e.g., leaf color)
- Clean separation of tree type and seasonal logic
- No conditionals in tree code

**3. Open-Closed Principle**
- New employee types with minimal impact
- New publication types
- New search methods
- Multiple hotel instances support
